# Big data {#bigdata}

In this Chapter, we are going to review different approaches to handle and perform analyses on *data that does not fit in memory*.

We will illustrate the different tools with data from the MovieLens datasets (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) that collect datasets from the website https://movielens.org/.

There are datasets of different sizes notably:

1. Small (1MB)
2. Benchmark (~190MB zipped)

## Sampling

## Pure R solutions

## JVM solutions

### h20

### Spark
