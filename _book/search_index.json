We will use R to present concepts that are mostly language-agnostic. We could have used Python, as in BST261 (Data Science II). 2.2 Syllabus Week 1 - Basic tools Lecture 1. Unix scripting, make Lecture 2. Version control: Git and GitHub (guest lecture: Ista Zhan) Week 2 - Creating and maintaining R packages Lecture 3. Rationale, package structure, available tools Lecture 4. Basics of software engineering: unit testing, continuous integration, code coverage Week 3 - Software optimization Lecture 5. Measuring performance: profiling and benchmarking tools Lecture 6. Improving performance: an introduction to C/C++, Rcpp Week 4 – Databases Lecture 7. Overview of SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL) and noSQL databases (HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra, BigTable, …) Lecture 8. R database interfaces (in particular through dplyr) Week 5 - Analyzing data that does not fit in memory Lecture 9. Pure R solutions (sampling, ff and ffbase, other interpreters). JVM solutions (h20, Spark) Lecture 10. An introduction to parallel computing; clusters and cloud computing. “Divide and Conquer” (MapReduce approaches) Week 6 – Visualization Lecture 11. Principles of visualization (guest lecture: James Honaker) Lecture 12. Maps and GIS: principles of GIS, using R as a GIS, PostGIS Weeks 7 &amp; 8 - Guest lectures (order and precise schedule TBD) Software project management (Danny Brooke) R and Spark (Ellen Kraffmiller and Robert Treacy) Advanced GIS and remote sensing (TBD) Cluster architecture (William J. Horka) 2.3 Evaluation Grades will be based on two mandatory problem sets. Each problem set will correspond to 50% (= 50 points) of the final grade. The first problem set will be available by the end of week 3 and the second problem set by the end of week 6. You will be required to submit problem set solutions within two weeks. Grades, and feedback when appropriate, will be returned two weeks after submission. You will submit a markdown document that combines commented code for data analysis and detailed and structured explanations of the algorithms and software tools that you used. 2.4 Software packages We will mostly use R in this course. Some examples will be run in Python. In general, we will use free and open-source software programs such as PostgreSQL or Spark. 2.5 Datasets 2.5.1 MovieLens MovieLens by Harper and Konstan (2015, https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) collects datasets from the website https://movielens.org/. There are datasets of different sizes, notably: Small (1MB) Benchmark (~190MB zipped) ratings &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data17/ml-latest-small/ratings.csv&quot;) head(ratings) ## userId movieId rating timestamp ## 1 1 31 2.5 1260759144 ## 2 1 1029 3.0 1260759179 ## 3 1 1061 3.0 1260759182 ## 4 1 1129 2.0 1260759185 ## 5 1 1172 4.0 1260759205 ## 6 1 1263 2.0 1260759151 links &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data17/ml-latest-small/links.csv&quot;) head(links) ## movieId imdbId tmdbId ## 1 1 114709 862 ## 2 2 113497 8844 ## 3 3 113228 15602 ## 4 4 114885 31357 ## 5 5 113041 11862 ## 6 6 113277 949 movies &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data17/ml-latest-small/movies.csv&quot;) head(movies) ## movieId title ## 1 1 Toy Story (1995) ## 2 2 Jumanji (1995) ## 3 3 Grumpier Old Men (1995) ## 4 4 Waiting to Exhale (1995) ## 5 5 Father of the Bride Part II (1995) ## 6 6 Heat (1995) ## genres ## 1 Adventure|Animation|Children|Comedy|Fantasy ## 2 Adventure|Children|Fantasy ## 3 Comedy|Romance ## 4 Comedy|Drama|Romance ## 5 Comedy ## 6 Action|Crime|Thriller tags &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data17/ml-latest-small/tags.csv&quot;) head(tags) ## userId movieId tag timestamp ## 1 15 339 sandra &#39;boring&#39; bullock 1138537770 ## 2 15 1955 dentist 1193435061 ## 3 15 7478 Cambodia 1170560997 ## 4 15 32892 Russian 1170626366 ## 5 15 34162 forgettable 1141391765 ## 6 15 35957 short 1141391873 2.5.2 Airlines data 2.5.3 Census 2.5.4 Health claims 2.5.5 GIS: PM2.5 exposure PM2.5 exposure 2.5.6 Methylation? 2.5.7 Genomics?? 2.5.8 GWAS Placeholder "]
